PLC-to-STM32F4-communication-through-PC-as-gateway
==================================================

This project has been made using the STM32F4 accelerometer and a Siemens S7-300 unit. The microcontroller is programmed to send data to a PC by using a serial-port communication; these data are read from a C# program that forward them to the PLC memory. Then, the PLC unit, that recognizes the microcontroller position, moves a mechanical arm.

This project was developed by Alessio Oglialoro and Daniele Saitta.
